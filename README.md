# Cloud_Data_Storage_DF_to_DB
This Project is about how to store the data into a cloud database from the dataframe which is exracted from an API
- I am continuting with the Data_Extraction_API Project here and trying to upload the dataframe values into a database.
- I used AWS Console to get my Cloud Database Setup.
- I used Postgre Database and then tried writing SQL queries to achieve this task.
- I used psycopg2 adapter to connect to the postgre AWS Database.
- I then uploaded the values returing from the API into the database and have also written a function to update it whenever new videos or changes to the existing videos are made in the youtube channel.

- The images can be viewed in the DB_images Folder of the Databse and it updates.
- Img1 - The DataFrame
- Img2 - The Old Dataframe Video Details in the Database
- Img3 - The New Uploaded videos in the channel, which are then reflecting in the Database as well.
